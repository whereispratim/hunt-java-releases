# Java 8 Features

Java 8 is a significant release that introduced several new features and enhancements to the Java programming language. Here's a summary of the key features:

## 1. Lambda Expressions
Lambda expressions provide a clear and concise way to represent one method interface using an expression. They enable functional programming in Java, allowing you to pass behavior as a parameter.

## 2. Functional Interfaces
Functional interfaces are interfaces with a single abstract method. Java 8 introduced several built-in functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package, such as `Function`, `Predicate`, and `Consumer`.

## 3. Streams API
The Streams API provides a new abstraction for processing sequences of elements. It supports functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as map, filter, and reduce, enabling efficient data processing.

## 4. Default Methods
Default methods allow interfaces to have method implementations. This feature enables the addition of new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

## 5. Optional Class
The `Optional` class is a container object used to contain not-null objects. It helps to avoid null pointer exceptions by providing a way to represent optional values.

## 6. New Date and Time API
Java 8 introduced a new Date and Time API in the `java.time` package. It provides a comprehensive set of classes for handling date and time, including `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, and `ZonedDateTime`.

## 7. Nashorn JavaScript Engine
Nashorn is a new lightweight JavaScript engine introduced in Java 8, which allows embedding JavaScript code within Java applications.

## 8. Method References
Method references provide a way to refer to methods without executing them. They are used in conjunction with lambda expressions and are represented using the `::` operator.

## 9. Collectors
The `Collectors` utility class provides various methods to collect the results of a stream into different forms, such as lists, sets, maps, and more complex structures.

## 10. Parallel Arrays
Java 8 provides parallel operations for arrays via the `Arrays.parallelSort` method, which allows sorting of arrays in parallel, leveraging multi-core architectures.

## 11. Base64 Encoding and Decoding
Java 8 introduced the `java.util.Base64` class, providing built-in methods for encoding and decoding Base64 data.

These features collectively enhance the Java programming language by introducing functional programming capabilities, improving date and time handling, and providing more powerful and flexible APIs for data processing.

# Java 22 Features

Java 22 introduces a range of new features aimed at enhancing performance, concurrency, code readability, and interoperability. Below is a summary of the key features:

## 1. Scoped Values (Finalized)
Scoped Values allow for the safe and efficient sharing of immutable data within and across threads, improving context management in concurrent programming.

## 2. Stream Gatherers (Preview)
Stream Gatherers enhance the flexibility and expressiveness of Stream pipelines by enabling custom intermediate data transformation operations.

## 3. Structured Concurrency (Second Preview)
This feature simplifies multithreaded programming by treating related tasks in separate threads as a single unit of work, improving code clarity and maintainability.

## 4. Statements Before Super (Preview)
Java 22 allows execution of statements in constructors before calling `super(...)` or `this(...)`, enabling argument validation and preparation directly in the constructor.

## 5. Class-File API (Preview)
The Class-File API provides a standard way to parse, generate, and transform Java class files, making it easier to manipulate bytecode.

## 6. Region Pinning for G1 Garbage Collector
This improvement reduces latency in garbage collection, enhancing the performance of applications that use the G1 Garbage Collector.

## 7. String Templates (Second Preview)
String Templates enable the creation of strings with embedded expressions, improving readability and reducing boilerplate code.

## 8. Unnamed Variables and Patterns (Finalized)
This feature allows the use of underscore `_` for unnamed patterns and variables, enhancing code clarity and conciseness.

## 9. Foreign Function & Memory API (Finalized)
The Foreign Function & Memory API improves interoperability with code and data outside the Java runtime, allowing easier integration with native libraries.

## 10. Vector API (Seventh Incubator)
The Vector API enables the expression of vector computations that can be compiled at runtime to optimal vector hardware instructions, improving performance for numerical applications.

## 11. Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods (Second Preview)
This feature simplifies writing small programs by allowing methods to be defined outside of explicit class declarations, making it easier for beginners.

## 12. Launch Multi-File Source-Code Programs
Java 22 allows running applications consisting of multiple source files without prior compilation, streamlining the development process.
